The following SQL statement over tables R(c,d), S(f,g), and T(a,b) requires certain privileges to execute:

```sql
UPDATE T
SET a=1, b=2
WHERE a <= ALL (SELECT d FROM R)
OR EXISTS (SELECT f FROM S WHERE f > T.a)
```

Which of the following privileges is not useful for execution of this SQL statement?

Answer choices and analysis
-

**1. SELECT ON T(a)**

    This is required to read in `WHERE f > T.a`.

**2. SELECT ON R**

    We do need to select `d` from `R`. This is an excessive privilege, but is it useless?

**3. SELECT ON R(d)**

    We need this to select `d` from `R`.

**4. SELECT ON T(b)**

    This is useless. We never read the value of `T.b`; we only write to it.
