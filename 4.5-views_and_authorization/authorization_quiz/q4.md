Q4
=

Consider a set of users U, V, W, X, and Y. Suppose user U creates a table T and thus is the owner of T. Now suppose the following set of statements is executed in order:

```
1. User U: grant select on T to V,W with grant option
2. User V: grant select on T to W
3. User W: grant select on T to X,Y
4. User U: grant select on T to Y
5. User U: revoke select on T from V restrict
6. User U: revoke select on T from W cascade
```

Which of the following statements is true?

Answer choices and analysis
-

**1. V has privilege SELECT ON T after statement 5**

    False. U successfully revoked V's privileges.

**2. Y has privilege SELECT ON T after statement 6**

    True. Y still has privileges directly from U, even though a revocation cascaded through W to Y.

**3. X does not have SELECT ON T privilege after statement 5**

    False. X still has privileges because W still has privileges, which were never revoked by U.

**4. Y does not have privilege SELECT ON T after statement 6**

    False. See option 2.
