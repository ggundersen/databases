Consider the following schema:

```sql
Book(ISBN, title, year) // ISBN and title cannot be NULL
Author(ISBN, name) // ISBN and name cannot be NULL
```

and the following view definition over this schema:

```sql
Create View V as
  Select Book.ISBN, count(*)
  From Book, Author
  Where Book.ISBN = Author.ISBN
  And Author.name Like 'A%'
  And Book.year > 2000
  Group By Book.ISBN
```

This view is not updatable according to the SQL standard, for a number of reasons. Which of the following is a valid reason for the view being non-updatable according to the standard?

Answer choices and analysis
-

**1. NULL values are not permitted in Book.ISBN**

    This is necessary but not sufficient. ISBN could have a default value. It does not, but that is not stated in the reason.

**2. The condition Author.name Like 'A%'**

    Assuming this is correct syntax, this just selects authors whose names begin with "A".

**3. Book.year is omitted from the view**

    Not sure what this means, but it doesn't seem to be true.

**4. Two tables in FROM clause**

    Yes, can only select from a single table.
