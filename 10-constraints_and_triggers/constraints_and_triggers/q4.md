Analysis
-

##### Deleting (3,5) from T
No error. Deletes from referencing table are fine.

##### Inserting (6,1) into T
This throws an error because there is no S(c) = 1

##### Deleting (5,13) from S
This throws an error because T(b) references this value in S(c)

##### Deleting (4,12) from S
This throws an error because T(b) references this value in S(c)
