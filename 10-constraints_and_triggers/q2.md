CREATE TRIGGER Rins
AFTER INSERT ON R
REFERENCING NEW ROW AS new
FOR EACH ROW
INSERT INTO R(a,b)
    (SELECT DISTINCT R.a, new.b
    FROM R
    WHERE R.b = new.a)
    EXCEPT
    (SELECT DISTINCT a,b FROM R)
```

> Suppose table R is empty initially. We issue three commands to insert tuples into R: first we insert (1,2), then we insert (2,3), then we insert (3,4). After some of these inserts, trigger Rins may insert further tuples into R, which may activate the trigger recursively. After all the inserts are done, which of these tuples is NOT in table R?

Analysis
-

Final table:
```
(1,2) <-- first insert
(1,2) <-- trigger
(2,3) <-- second insert
(1,3) <-- trigger, insert existing a and new b
(3,4) <-- third insert
(2,4) <-- trigger
(1,4) <-- trigger
```

Answer choices
-

(2,4)
_(3,2)_ (Not in final table)
(1,3)
(1,4)
