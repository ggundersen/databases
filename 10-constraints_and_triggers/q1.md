CREATE TABLE R (a INT, b INT, c INT, CHECK( [fill-in] ));
```

> Currently R contains the tuples (1,4,14), (2,3,15), and (3,3,16). Which of the following tuple-based CHECK constraints will cause the following insertion to be rejected? 

> INSERT INTO R VALUES (4,4,9);

(1,4,14), (2,3,15), and (3,3,16)

(4,4,9)


> a < (SELECT COUNT(c) FROM R)
_False. After the insert, COUNT(c) will return 4. The new value a=4 is not less than 4._


> c > ALL (SELECT a + b FROM R)
True. If we select a+b for every tuple, we get:
```
1+4=5
2+3=5
3+3=6
4+4=8
```
In this case, the new value c=9 is true for every row.


> c <= ALL (SELECT b + c FROM R)
True. If we select b+c for every tuple, we get:
```
4+14=18
3+15=18
3+16=19
4+9=13
```
In this case, the new value c=9 is true for every row.

> b < (SELECT MIN(c) FROM R) 
True. min(c) is 9, and the new value b=4 is less than 9.
