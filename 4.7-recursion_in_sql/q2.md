Consider a relation Manager(manager,employee) where a tuple (m,e) in Manager specifies that person m is the manager of person e. The only key for Manager is both attributes together. The following recursive SQL query computes the relation Peer(X,Y).

```sql
With Recursive Peer(X,Y) As
    (Select M1.employee, M2.employee
    From Manager M1, Manager M2
    Where M1.manager = M2.manager AND M1.employee < M2.employee
    Union
    Select M1.employee, M2.employee
    From Peer S, Manager M1, Manager M2
    Where S.X = M1.manager AND S.Y = M2.manager
    And M1.employee < M2.employee)
Select * from Peer
```

Suppose the tuples in Manager are: (10, 9), (10,8), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,4), (7,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1). Consider the computation of Peer in the recursive query. Let the base case -- the first term of the Union -- be "round 1." Let each subsequent round of the recursion be "round 2," "round 3," and so on. Which of the following is a correct statement about when a pair gets added to Peer? (You may find it helpful to draw a figure that shows the Manager relationships.)

Rounds

**Initial state of `Manager`:**

(8,6)
(8,5)
(7,4)
(7,3)

**Round One:**

```
Base query
(8,9)
(6,7)
(5,6)
(3,4)
(2,3)
(1,2)

Union

Recursive query

[My guess is that the recursion section is empty after the first round]
```

**Round Two:**

Peer(X,Y) (base query)

```
(8,9)
(6,7)
(5,6)
(3,4)
(2,3)
(1,2)
```

Recursion

```
(6,7) -- Their managers 8,9 are peers -- Already exists!
(5,7) -- Their managers 8,9 are peers
(4,6)
(4,5)
(3,6)
(3,5)
(3,4) -- Their managers 6,7 are peers -- Already exists!
(2,4) -- Their managers 6,7 are peers
(2,3) -- Their managers 6,7 are peers -- Already exists!
(1,3) -- Their managers 5,6 are peers
(1,2) -- Their managers 5,6 are peers -- Already exists!
```

**Round Three:**

Peer(X,Y) (base query)

```
(8,9)
(6,7)
(5,7)
(5,6)
(4,6)
(4,5)
(3,6)
(3,5)
(3,4)
(2,4)
(2,3)
(1,3)
(1,2)
```

Recursion

```
(1,4) -- Their managers (5,7) are peers
...
```

Answer choices and analysis
-

1. (7,8) is added in round 2.

    No. 7 and 8's managers, 9 and 10 respectively, are not peers.

2. (5,7) is added in round 1.

    No. (5,7) is added in round 2.

3. (2,3) is added in round 2.

    No. (2,3) is added in round 1.

4. (1,4) is added in round 3.
