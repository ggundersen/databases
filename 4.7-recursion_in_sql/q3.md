Consider a relation Parent(par,child), where a tuple (p,c) in Parent specifies that person p is the parent of person c. The only key for Parent is both attributes together. We are interested in writing a recursive SQL query to find all descendants of the person named "Eve." Here are six possible definitions of a recursive relation Ancestor(X,Y). Note that some of the definitions include nonlinear recursion, which technically is not permitted in the strict SQL standard.

1.
```sql
With Recursive Ancestor(X,Y) As
    (Select par, child From Parent
    Union
    Select Ancestor.X, Parent.child
    From Ancestor, Parent
    Where Ancestor.Y = Parent.par)
```

2.
```sql
With Recursive Ancestor(X,Y) As
    (Select par, child From Parent Where par = 'Eve'
    Union
    Select Ancestor.X, Parent.child
    From Ancestor, Parent
    Where Ancestor.Y = Parent.par)
```

3.
```sql
With Recursive Ancestor(X,Y) As
    (Select par, child From Parent
    Union
    Select Parent.par, Ancestor.Y
    From Parent, Ancestor
    Where Parent.child = Ancestor.X)
```

4.
```sql
With Recursive Ancestor(X,Y) As
    (Select par, child From Parent
    Union
    Select Parent.par, Ancestor.Y
    From Parent, Ancestor
    Where Parent.child = Ancestor.X and Parent.par = 'Eve')
```

5.
```sql
With Recursive Ancestor(X,Y) As
    (Select par, child From Parent Where par = 'Eve'
    Union
    Select A1.X, A2.Y
    From Ancestor A1, Ancestor A2
    Where A1.Y = A2.X)
```

6.
```sql
With Recursive Ancestor(X,Y) As
    (Select par, child From Parent
    Union
    Select A1.X, A2.Y
    From Ancestor A1, Ancestor A2
    Where A1.Y = A2.X and A1.X = 'Eve')
```

Consider two possible queries that can be used to complete any of the WITH statements (1)-(6):

A: Select Y From Ancestor
B: Select Y From Ancestor Where X = 'Eve'

Which of the following combinations correctly computes the descendants of "Eve"?

1. (A) gives the correct answer with (2) only.

    Yes. (A) only works with (2).

2. (A) gives the correct answer with (2) and (3) only.

    No. (A) won't work with (3) because neither query filters by "Eve".

3. Neither (A) nor (B) give the correct answer with (3) and (5).

4. Neither (A) nor (B) give the correct answer with (6).

    No. (B) should give the correct answer.
