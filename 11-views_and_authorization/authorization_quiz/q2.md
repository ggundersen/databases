Q2
=

Consider a set of users A, B, C, D, E. Suppose user A creates a table T and thus is the owner of T. Now suppose the following set of statements is executed in order:

```
1. User A: grant update on T to B,C with grant option
2. User B: grant update on T to D with grant option
3. User C: grant update on T to D with grant option
4. User D: grant update on T to E
5. User A: revoke update on T from C cascade
```

After execution of statement 5, which of the following is true?

**1. E no longer has privilege UPDATE ON T**

    No, E has privileges through D, which still has privileges through B. In fact, the revocation would have failed without B because `restrict` is default.

**2. Both D and E have privilege UPDATE ON T, but C doesn't**

    Yes, this is true.

**3. A no longer has privilege UPDATE ON T**

    No, A revoked B's privileges. The revocation does not bubble up the graph.

**4. C has privilege UPDATE ON T**

    No, A revoked C's privileges.
