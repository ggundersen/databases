The following SQL statement over tables R(a,b), S(b,c), and T(a,c) requires certain privileges to execute:

```sql
UPDATE R
SET a = 10
WHERE b IN (SELECT c FROM S)
AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT a FROM T WHERE T.a = R.a)
```

Which of the following privileges is not useful for execution of this SQL statement?

**1. SELECT ON T**

    Assuming this means a user can select any attribute from `T`, then this is useful since we need `T.a`.

**2. SELECT ON R(a)**

    This is required for the join `T.a = R.a`.

**3. SELECT ON T(a)**

    This is required for the join `T.a = R.a`.

**4. SELECT ON T(b)**

    This privilege is not only useless for this SQL statement but for any, since there is no `T.b`.
