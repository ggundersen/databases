Consider the following base tables. Capitalized attributes are primary keys. All non-key attributes are permitted to be NULL.

```sql
MovieStar(NAME, address, gender, birthdate)
MovieExecutive(LICENSE#, name, address, netWorth)
Studio(NAME, address, presidentLicense#)
```

Each of the choices describes, in English, a view that could be created with a query on these tables. Which one can be written as a SQL view that is updatable according to the SQL standard?

Answer choices and analysis
-

**1. A view "RichExecNums" containing the license number and net worth of all executives with a net worth of at least $10,000,000.**

    Meets all criteria: selects from a single table MovieExecutive, attributes are allowed to be NULL, no subqueries refering to MovieExecutive, no aggregation. 

**2. A view "Birthdays" containing a list of birthdates (no duplicates) belonging to at least one movie star.**

    DISTINCT is not allowed.

**3. A view "StudioPresInfo" containing the studio name, executive name, and license number for all executives who are studio presidents.**

    JOINS are not allowed.

**4. A view "SameBirthday" containing pairs of movie star names where the movie stars have the same birthdate.**

    Subqueries must not refer to the table in the outermost select.
