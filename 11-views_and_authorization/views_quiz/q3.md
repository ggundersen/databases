Suppose a table T(A,B,C) has the following tuples: (1,1,3), (1,2,3), (2,1,4), (2,3,5), (2,4,1), (3,2,4), and (3,3,6). Consider the following view definition: 

```sql
Create View V as
  Select A+B as D, C
  From T
```

Consider the following query over view V:

```sql
  Select D, sum(C)
  From V
  Group By D
  Having Count(*) <> 1
```

Answer choices
-

Which of the following tuples is in the query result?

1. (5,11)
2. (3,5)
3. (5,9)
4. (5,7)

Analysis

The table `T`:

```
(A,B,C)
(1,1,3)
(1,2,3)
(2,1,4)
(2,3,5)
(2,4,1)
(3,2,4)
(3,3,6)
```

The view `V`:

```
(D,C)
(2,3)
(3,3)
(3,4)
(5,5)
(6,1)
(5,4)
(6,6)

```

Query result over `V`:

`GROUP BY D`

```
(2,3)

(3,3)
(3,4)

(5,5)
(5,4)

(6,1)
(6,6)
```

`HAVING COUNT(*) <> 1` (this means not equal to 1)

```
(3,3)
(3,4)

(5,5)
(5,4)

(6,1)
(6,6)
```

`SUM(C)`

```
(3,7)
(3,7)
(5,9)
(5,9)
(6,7)
(6,7)
```
