```
CREATE TABLE Emps (id INT, ssNo INT, name CHAR(20), managerID INT);
```

> We would like to extend the table declaration to enforce that each of id and ssNo is a key (by itself), and each value of managerID must be one of the values that appears in the id attribute of the same table. Which of the following is not a legal addition of SQL standard key and/or foreign-key constraints? Note: The addition does not have to achieve all of the stated goals; it only must result in legal SQL.

Analysis
   
> Add "PRIMARY KEY" after the first INT, and add "REFERENCES Emps(id)" before the closing parenthesis.
```
CREATE TABLE Emps (id INT PRIMARY KEY, ssNo INT, name CHAR(20), managerID INT REFERENCES Emps(id));
```
This is legal. Also, successfully ran on local.


> Add "UNIQUE" after each of the first two INT's.
```
CREATE TABLE Emps (id INT UNIQUE, ssNo INT UNIQUE, name CHAR(20), managerID INT);
```
This doesn't achieve its goals, but it is legal.


> Add "PRIMARY KEY" after the first INT, and add "UNIQUE" after the second INT.
```
CREATE TABLE Emps (id INT PRIMARY KEY, ssNo INT UNIQUE, name CHAR(20), managerID INT);
```
Doesn't achieve goal, but is legal.


> Add ", FOREIGN KEY (managerID) REFERENCES Emps(id)" before the closing parenthesis. 
```
CREATE TABLE Emps (id INT, ssNo INT, name CHAR(20), managerID INT, FOREIGN KEY (managerID) REFERENCES Emps(id));
```
_This is not valid because id has not been indexed._
