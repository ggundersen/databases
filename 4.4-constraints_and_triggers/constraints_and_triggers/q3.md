> ```sql
> CREATE TABLE Emps (id INT, ssNo INT, name CHAR(20), managerID INT);
> ```
> We would like to extend the table declaration to enforce that each of id and ssNo is a key (by itself), and each value of managerID must be one of the values that appears in the id attribute of the same table. Which of the following is not a legal addition of SQL standard key and/or foreign-key constraints? Note: The addition does not have to achieve all of the stated goals; it only must result in legal SQL.

Analysis
-
   
##### Add "PRIMARY KEY" after the first INT, and add "REFERENCES Emps(id)" before the closing parenthesis.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Emps (id INT PRIMARY KEY, ssNo INT, name CHAR(20), managerID INT REFERENCES Emps(id));
```
Legal.


##### Add "UNIQUE" after each of the first two INT's.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Emps (id INT UNIQUE, ssNo INT UNIQUE, name CHAR(20), managerID INT);
```
Doesn't achieve goal, but is legal.


##### Add "PRIMARY KEY" after the first INT, and add "UNIQUE" after the second INT.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Emps (id INT PRIMARY KEY, ssNo INT UNIQUE, name CHAR(20), managerID INT);
```
Doesn't achieve goal, but is legal.


##### Add ", FOREIGN KEY (managerID) REFERENCES Emps(id)" before the closing parenthesis. 
```sql
CREATE TABLE Emps (id INT, ssNo INT, name CHAR(20), managerID INT, FOREIGN KEY (managerID) REFERENCES Emps(id));
```
This is not valid because `id` has not been indexed.
