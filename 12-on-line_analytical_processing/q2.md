Q2
=

Consider a fact table `Facts(D1,D2,D3,x)`, and the following three queries:

```sql
Q1: Select D1,D2,D3,Sum(x)
    From Facts
    Group By D1,D2,D3
Q2: Select D1,D2,D3,Sum(x)
    From Facts
    Group By D1,D2,D3 WITH CUBE
Q3: Select D1,D2,D3,Sum(x)
    From Facts
    Group By D1,D2,D3 WITH ROLLUP
```

Suppose attributes D1, D2, and D3 have n1, n2, and n3 different values respectively, and assume that each possible combination of values appears at least once in table Facts. The number of tuples in the result of each of the three queries above can be specified as an arithmetic formula involving n1, n2, and n3. Pick the one tuple (a,b,c,d,e,f) in the list below such that when n1=a, n2=b, and n3=c, then the result sizes of queries Q1, Q2, and Q3 are d, e, and f respectively. (Hint: It may be helpful to first write formulas describing how d, e, and f depend on a, b, and c. Then find the answer that satisfies your formulas.)

c = a*b*c

**1. (4, 7, 3, 84, 160, 84)**
**2. (4, 7, 3, 84, 87, 117)**

    Wrong. We know `WITH ROLLUP` will always return fewer results than `WITH CUBE`.

**3. (2, 2, 2, 8, 64, 15)**
**4. (5, 4, 3, 60, 120, 86)**
