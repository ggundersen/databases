Consider a fact table `Sales(saleID, itemID, color, size, qty, unitPrice)`, and the following three queries:

```sql
Q1: Select itemID, color, size, Sum(qty*unitPrice)
    From Sales
    Group By itemID, color, size
Q2: Select itemID, size, Sum(qty*unitPrice)
    From Sales
    Group By itemID, size
Q3: Select itemID, size, Sum(qty*unitPrice)
    From Sales
    Where size < 10
    Group By itemID, size 
```

Depending on the order in which we execute two of these queries, the pair of actions may be viewed as an example of roll-up, drill-down or slicing. Which of the following statements is correct?

**1. Going from Q3 to Q2 is an example of drill-down.**

    Incorrect. Q3 and Q2 have the same number of attributes in their GROUP BY clauses.

**2. Going from Q1 to Q2 is an example of drill-down.**

    Incorrect. Q1 has more attributes in its GROUP BY clause. This is an example of a roll-up.

**3. Going from Q1 to Q2 is an example of slicing.**

    Incorrect. Slicing requires constraining one of the dimensions of the data cube.

**4. Going from Q2 to Q1 is an example of drill-down.** 

    Correct. Q1 has more attributes than Q2, so this is a drill-down.
