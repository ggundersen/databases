Consider a relation Manager(manager,employee) where a tuple (m,e) in Manager specifies that person m is the manager of person e. The only key for Manager is both attributes together. The following recursive SQL query computes the relation Peer(X,Y).

```sql
With Recursive Peer(X,Y) As
    (Select M1.employee, M2.employee
    From Manager M1, Manager M2
    Where M1.manager = M2.manager AND M1.employee < M2.employee
    Union
    Select M1.employee, M2.employee
    From Peer S, Manager M1, Manager M2
    Where S.X = M1.manager AND S.Y = M2.manager
    And M1.employee < M2.employee)
Select * from Peer
```

Suppose the tuples in Manager are: (10, 9), (10,8), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,4), (7,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1). Consider the computation of Peer in the recursive query. Let the base case -- the first term of the Union -- be "round 1." Let each subsequent round of the recursion be "round 2," "round 3," and so on. Which of the following is a correct statement about when a pair gets added to Peer? (You may find it helpful to draw a figure that shows the Manager relationships.)

Rounds

**Initial state of `Manager`:**

```
(10,9)
(10,8)
(9,7)
(9,6)
(8,6)
(8,5)
(7,4)
(7,3)
(6,3)
(6,2)
(5,2)
(5,1)
```

**Round One:**

```
Base query
(8,9)
(6,7)
(5,6)
(3,4)
(2,3)
(1,2)

Union

Recursive query

[My guess is that the recursion section is empty after the first round]
```

**Round Two:**

Peer(X,Y) (base query)

```
(8,9)
(6,7)
(5,6)
(3,4)
(2,3)
(1,2)
```

Recursion

```
(6,7) -- Their managers 8,9 are peers
(5,7) -- Their managers 8,9 are peers
(2,3) -- Their managers 6,7 are peers
(1,3) -- Their managers 5,6 are peers
(1,2) -- Their managers 5,6 are peers
```

Answer choices and analysis
-



1. (10,10) is added at round 1.

    No. See above.

2. (5,7) is added in round 2.

    Yes. See above.

3. (3,3) is added in round 2.

    No. The `WHERE` clause requires that `M1.employee < M2.employee`.

4. (1,3) is added in round 3.

    No. (1,3) is added in round 2.
