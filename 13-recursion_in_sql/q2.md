Consider a relation Manager(manager,employee) where a tuple (m,e) in Manager specifies that person m is the manager of person e. The only key for Manager is both attributes together. The following recursive SQL query computes the relation Peer(X,Y).

```sql
With Recursive Peer(X,Y) As
    (Select M1.employee, M2.employee
    From Manager M1, Manager M2
    Where M1.manager = M2.manager AND M1.employee < M2.employee
    Union
    Select M1.employee, M2.employee
    From Peer S, Manager M1, Manager M2
    Where S.X = M1.manager AND S.Y = M2.manager
    And M1.employee < M2.employee)
Select * from Peer
```

Suppose the tuples in Manager are: (10, 9), (10,8), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,4), (7,3), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1). Consider the computation of Peer in the recursive query. Let the base case -- the first term of the Union -- be "round 1." Let each subsequent round of the recursion be "round 2," "round 3," and so on. Which of the following is a correct statement about when a pair gets added to Peer? (You may find it helpful to draw a figure that shows the Manager relationships.)
